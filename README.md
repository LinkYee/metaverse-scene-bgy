This project enables the shop prefab in the editor as well as additional Ethereal XRUI tooling for product detail, shopping carts, and checkout. 

This tooling is used primarly in the editor to access diffrenet storefront APIs directly from the client so the system is lightweight and fast. These instances are held in the editor until saved; when a product is ready to be used, it will be converted into a product prefab.

More documenation in progress. Please ask on our discord for help.
